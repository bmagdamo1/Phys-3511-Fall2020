    "**b)** You should notice that there appear to be two clear distributions here. One which seems to be centered E/p = 0.6 and another around E/p = 1. The population at the lower E/p represent pions, whereas the population around E/p = 1 are electrons. For this exersice we will treat the pions as a background and the electrons as our signal. We will model each particle type to have a Gaussian distribution. Define two functions, one that returns a value computed from a Gaussian value, and anther function that returns a value computed from the sum of two Gaussian functions. Then make a fit to the data using the sum of two Gaussian functions. Each of your Gaussian functions can take the form of:\n",

    "**e)** We can use the $E/p$ distribution to try to select the maximum number of electron while minimizing the pions that *leak* into our electron signal. We can do this by requireing our selected sample to be larger than some $E/p$ threshold value. Any data that has an $E/p$ value lower then the threshold we throw it out. In a physics analysis this is called a cut. However we need to be careful, if we place a cut at $E/p$ that is too large we will have a really clean electron sample, but throw away a lot of good electrons. On the other hand if we make the $E/p$ cut too low we will keep most of our electrons, but let in a lot of background (pions). So we must compormise between clean data and statistics. To do this lets calculat the total number of electrons we have from $0.0 < E/p < 2$. This can be obtained by integrating (you can use scipy integrators, I used *integrate.quad* when doing this exersise)the electron contribution from our fit. We will call this number e_tot. Do a similar thing for the total pions and call that number pi_tot. \n",

    "For 10 equally spaced E/p thresholds between 0.3 and 0.8, calculate the number of electrons that are above each of the thresholds, we can call this array e_sig and can be obtained by integrating from the E/p threshold to the E/p = 2. Do a similar thing for the pion distribution. \n",
